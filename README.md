## Getting Started

To get a local copy follow these simple example steps.

- Make sure you have Postgres and Ruby installed.
- Open the terminal window and clone the repository using this command: git clone https://github.com/wuletawwonte/rmis.git
- Open the repo by typing : cd rmis
- Install the project's dependencies by running this command: bundle install
- Run `rails db:create` to create the database.
- Run rails `rails db:schema:load` to create the relations in the database for the project based on the schema file inside the `db` folder. 
- Run rails server or rails s to start the application on local server.
- To test the project, run rspec in your terminal
- To test mailer use `mailcatcher` gem, It's not in the Gemfile but I used it to catch mails. Here are the instructions of using it
    - Run `gem install mailcatcher`
    - Run `mailcatcher` to start the mail catcher server
    - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:1080`
    - Send mail through smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 

## Sidekiq setup
[Active jobs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) of Rails is used to handle declaring and running jobs asynchronously. The adapter used for background jobs in the project is `Sidekiq`. Since `Sidekiq` uses [redis](https://redis.io/) to store queue of background jobs, redis server must be installed for sidekiq to work.

For ubuntu users run this command to install redis server

```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
```
Once installed, make sure the service is running by running: `sudo systemctl status redis`

Finaly after starting rails server `sidekiq` must run in the background by running this command
```bash
bundle exec sidekiq -q default -q mailers
```
